This project is for testing interaction with a remote Progress Apama correlator.

The project contains 4 test classes. In order of complexity:
- 1. BasicTest
- 2. SendAndReceiveEvents
- 3. InjectEpl
- 4. InjectJavaApplication

Since Progress Apama is not open-source software, its jar files are not
available for download from any Maven repository, and their transitive
dependencies are not declared anywhere.

So, Apama dependencies are copied from UPG 12B, and then a local repository is
created to hold them; and since their transitive dependencies are unknown, a
trial and error approach is used: when a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException error
appears at execution time, then it means that a new transitive dependency has
been identified, and the related dependency's POM file must be updated
accordingly.

The aformentioned method for identifying transitive dependencies does not
guarantee that all of them will be identified. Therefore, a safer method should
be used, such as analyzing the jar files' bytecode using some 3pt tool. For the
time being, it is left as it is.

The remote correlator may have been started from Apama Studio 5.0, or manually.

For starting a correlator manually:
cd <apama_instl_folder>\bin
.\apama_env.bat
.\correlator -l <path_to_license.txt> -j
